We welcome any and all contributions to Meyda, including filing issues, feature requests, pull requests, feedback, and any other comments. Please familiarise yourself with our [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/hughrawlinson/meyda/wiki/Contributor-Covenant). The core contributors are quite limited on time, so we'd really appreciate if you could stick to the following few rules:

### Filing issues
* Bug reports
  * Please include comprehensive instructions for us to reproduce the bug. If you can include the source, please do.
  * If you have the time, please consider finding the problem within Meyda yourself, and if you're feeling generous have a go at fixing it and submitting a pull request.
* Feature requests
  * Keep in mind that the core contributors are not full time Meyda developers.
  * If there's a feature you really want that we don't yet support, please consider implementing it yourself and submitting a pull request.
  
### Pull Requests
  * Please try and stick to a similar coding style to what currently exists.
  * Make sure your change is covered by tests.
  * If you have to make an implementation decision, feel free to ask us for our input by opening an issue on the repository. This may save time in code review.
  * Bear in mind that we're not working on Meyda full time, so it may take us a while to review your code.

### Build the project
1. Remember to do it.
2. `npm run default`
3. This will run tests, so make sure they all pass and try and make sure any new code you're submitting is covered properly.
